This MVP should be a cohesive product in that it combines methods in some logical pipeline, it should NOT simply be a collection of methods implemented independently/separately with no clear end goal/state. You will be tasked with applying at least four methods from across the four units, which I've outlined below:\n",

This helps you easily find and compare different advice topics and feelings. The Question-Answering System takes this neat text and lets you ask specific questions, giving you personalized answers. All these steps come together in a dashboard that's easy to use. You can sift through, understand, and get involved with the world of parenting advice, showcasing how mixing different text mining methods can unlock useful insights from loads of messy data."

She\\u2019s been doing this for about a year.\\n\\nThis morning she woke me up to let me know that she was about to leave as she usually does. \\n\\nAfter a little while she came back into my room and asked if i wanted to come with her. I was very surprised and a little confused but immediately agreed.\\n\\nShe said she didn\\u2019t want to talk, just wanted to hike and listen to her AirPods. About halfway through my own AirPods died and she offered me one of hers. So we listened to an artist named Ethel Khan, I didn\\u2019t particularly care for the music but the bonding was so heartwarming for me.\\n\\nAfterwards we went to Panda Express and talked about music for a little bit in the car.\\n\\nIt was really nice, easily the most amount of time we\\u2019ve spent together since she was 14 and I hope she\\u2019s up to spend more time together in the future.\\n\",\n          \"If your baby sits up on their own, the grocery store is an amazing activity. Here are my tips/ reasons.\\n\\n\\n- park next to the cart corral\\n\\n- do a short list the first time \\n\\n- let grocery shopping take a long time eventually. Show your child every item and describe what it is. \\\"This is zucchini, it's green, it's a vegetable, mommy is going to roast it.\\\" The grocery store is an excellent place to teach your child a lot of words. There's endless source material, you will never run out of things to say. You can count how many tomatoes you're buying too. Now that mine is a little older she helps me out stuff in the cart. Even if it takes longer than shopping by yourself, you didn't just shop you entertained and did active education. \\n\\n- go when the old folks go if you can. Old folks love babies and many of them will give you and kiddo positive attention. Kiddo gets exposed to people they don't know, you get the good vibes you desperately need.\\n\\n- grocery stores are very stimulating and it's good for babies to experience new environments like that. \\n\\n- bring a snack/toy/bottle if you need to. My kid is 18m now and the store gives out free bananas to children. She wolfs a whole banana down every time we shop. \\n\\n- builds your confidence bringing a kid in public\\n\\n- my final point, the best reason to bring a baby grocery shopping: it reduces the amount of \\\"man hours\\\" in a day. Hear me out. If you have a spouse who shares the childcare, between the two of you you have to do a certain amount of active childcare time and chore time. Let's call that combined number 15 hours. If you spend an hour at the grocery store with your child, that's an hour of chore time and an hour of childcare over lapping reducing the over all load to 14 hours. While you are gone the spouse can either take a break or do some chores stuff. See how that \\\"opens\\\" another hour in the schedule?\",\n          \"Also wondering how many you initially wanted and how many you ended up having and why.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Comment_Content\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 80,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Just to clarify, he only booked plane tickets?

Here are my tips/ reasons.\\n\\n\\n- park next to the cart corral\\n\\n- do a short list the first time \\n\\n- let grocery shopping take a long time eventually. Show your child every item and describe what it is. \\\"This is zucchini, it's green, it's a vegetable, mommy is going to roast it.\\\" The grocery store is an excellent place to teach your child a lot of words. There's endless source material, you will never run out of things to say. You can count how many tomatoes you're buying too. Now that mine is a little older she helps me out stuff in the cart. Even if it takes longer than shopping by yourself, you didn't just shop you entertained and did active education. \\n\\n- go when the old folks go if you can. Old folks love babies and many of them will give you and kiddo positive attention. Kiddo gets exposed to people they don't know, you get the good vibes you desperately need.\\n\\n- grocery stores are very stimulating and it's good for babies to experience new environments like that. \\n\\n- bring a snack/toy/bottle if you need to. My kid is 18m now and the store gives out free bananas to children. She wolfs a whole banana down every time we shop. \\n\\n- builds your confidence bringing a kid in public\\n\\n- my final point, the best reason to bring a baby grocery shopping: it reduces the amount of \\\"man hours\\\" in a day. Hear me out. If you have a spouse who shares the childcare, between the two of you you have to do a certain amount of active childcare time and chore time. Let's call that combined number 15 hours. If you spend an hour at the grocery store with your child, that's an hour of chore time and an hour of childcare over lapping reducing the over all load to 14 hours. While you are gone the spouse can either take a break or do some chores stuff.

She\\u2019s been doing this for about a year.\\n\\nThis morning she woke me up to let me know that she was about to leave as she usually does. \\n\\nAfter a little while she came back into my room and asked if i wanted to come with her. I was very surprised and a little confused but immediately agreed.\\n\\nShe said she didn\\u2019t want to talk, just wanted to hike and listen to her AirPods. About halfway through my own AirPods died and she offered me one of hers. So we listened to an artist named Ethel Khan, I didn\\u2019t particularly care for the music but the bonding was so heartwarming for me.\\n\\nAfterwards we went to Panda Express and talked about music for a little bit in the car.\\n\\nIt was really nice, easily the most amount of time we\\u2019ve spent together since she was 14 and I hope she\\u2019s up to spend more time together in the future.\\n\",\n          \"If your baby sits up on their own, the grocery store is an amazing activity. Here are my tips/ reasons.\\n\\n\\n- park next to the cart corral\\n\\n- do a short list the first time \\n\\n- let grocery shopping take a long time eventually. Show your child every item and describe what it is. \\\"This is zucchini, it's green, it's a vegetable, mommy is going to roast it.\\\" The grocery store is an excellent place to teach your child a lot of words. There's endless source material, you will never run out of things to say. You can count how many tomatoes you're buying too. Now that mine is a little older she helps me out stuff in the cart. Even if it takes longer than shopping by yourself, you didn't just shop you entertained and did active education. \\n\\n- go when the old folks go if you can. Old folks love babies and many of them will give you and kiddo positive attention. Kiddo gets exposed to people they don't know, you get the good vibes you desperately need.\\n\\n- grocery stores are very stimulating and it's good for babies to experience new environments like that. \\n\\n- bring a snack/toy/bottle if you need to. My kid is 18m now and the store gives out free bananas to children. She wolfs a whole banana down every time we shop. \\n\\n- builds your confidence bringing a kid in public\\n\\n- my final point, the best reason to bring a baby grocery shopping: it reduces the amount of \\\"man hours\\\" in a day. Hear me out. If you have a spouse who shares the childcare, between the two of you you have to do a certain amount of active childcare time and chore time. Let's call that combined number 15 hours. If you spend an hour at the grocery store with your child, that's an hour of chore time and an hour of childcare over lapping reducing the over all load to 14 hours. While you are gone the spouse can either take a break or do some chores stuff. See how that \\\"opens\\\" another hour in the schedule?\",\n          \"Also wondering how many you initially wanted and how many you ended up having and why.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Comment_Content\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 80,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Just to clarify, he only booked plane tickets?

She\\u2019s been doing this for about a year.\\n\\nThis morning she woke me up to let me know that she was about to leave as she usually does. \\n\\nAfter a little while she came back into my room and asked if i wanted to come with her. I was very surprised and a little confused but immediately agreed.\\n\\nShe said she didn\\u2019t want to talk, just wanted to hike and listen to her AirPods. About halfway through my own AirPods died and she offered me one of hers. So we listened to an artist named Ethel Khan, I didn\\u2019t particularly care for the music but the bonding was so heartwarming for me.\\n\\nAfterwards we went to Panda Express and talked about music for a little bit in the car.\\n\\nIt was really nice, easily the most amount of time we\\u2019ve spent together since she was 14 and I hope she\\u2019s up to spend more time together in the future.\\n\",\n          \"If your baby sits up on their own, the grocery store is an amazing activity. Here are my tips/ reasons.\\n\\n\\n- park next to the cart corral\\n\\n- do a short list the first time \\n\\n- let grocery shopping take a long time eventually. Show your child every item and describe what it is. \\\"This is zucchini, it's green, it's a vegetable, mommy is going to roast it.\\\" The grocery store is an excellent place to teach your child a lot of words. There's endless source material, you will never run out of things to say. You can count how many tomatoes you're buying too. Now that mine is a little older she helps me out stuff in the cart. Even if it takes longer than shopping by yourself, you didn't just shop you entertained and did active education. \\n\\n- go when the old folks go if you can. Old folks love babies and many of them will give you and kiddo positive attention. Kiddo gets exposed to people they don't know, you get the good vibes you desperately need.\\n\\n- grocery stores are very stimulating and it's good for babies to experience new environments like that. \\n\\n- bring a snack/toy/bottle if you need to. My kid is 18m now and the store gives out free bananas to children. She wolfs a whole banana down every time we shop. \\n\\n- builds your confidence bringing a kid in public\\n\\n- my final point, the best reason to bring a baby grocery shopping: it reduces the amount of \\\"man hours\\\" in a day. Hear me out. If you have a spouse who shares the childcare, between the two of you you have to do a certain amount of active childcare time and chore time. Let's call that combined number 15 hours. If you spend an hour at the grocery store with your child, that's an hour of chore time and an hour of childcare over lapping reducing the over all load to 14 hours. While you are gone the spouse can either take a break or do some chores stuff. See how that \\\"opens\\\" another hour in the schedule?\",\n          \"Also wondering how many you initially wanted and how many you ended up having and why.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Comment_Content\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 80,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Just to clarify, he only booked plane tickets?

She\\u2019s been doing this for about a year.\\n\\nThis morning she woke me up to let me know that she was about to leave as she usually does. \\n\\nAfter a little while she came back into my room and asked if i wanted to come with her. I was very surprised and a little confused but immediately agreed.\\n\\nShe said she didn\\u2019t want to talk, just wanted to hike and listen to her AirPods. About halfway through my own AirPods died and she offered me one of hers. So we listened to an artist named Ethel Khan, I didn\\u2019t particularly care for the music but the bonding was so heartwarming for me.\\n\\nAfterwards we went to Panda Express and talked about music for a little bit in the car.\\n\\nIt was really nice, easily the most amount of time we\\u2019ve spent together since she was 14 and I hope she\\u2019s up to spend more time together in the future.\\n\",\n          \"If your baby sits up on their own, the grocery store is an amazing activity. Here are my tips/ reasons.\\n\\n\\n- park next to the cart corral\\n\\n- do a short list the first time \\n\\n- let grocery shopping take a long time eventually. Show your child every item and describe what it is. \\\"This is zucchini, it's green, it's a vegetable, mommy is going to roast it.\\\" The grocery store is an excellent place to teach your child a lot of words. There's endless source material, you will never run out of things to say. You can count how many tomatoes you're buying too. Now that mine is a little older she helps me out stuff in the cart. Even if it takes longer than shopping by yourself, you didn't just shop you entertained and did active education. \\n\\n- go when the old folks go if you can. Old folks love babies and many of them will give you and kiddo positive attention. Kiddo gets exposed to people they don't know, you get the good vibes you desperately need.\\n\\n- grocery stores are very stimulating and it's good for babies to experience new environments like that. \\n\\n- bring a snack/toy/bottle if you need to. My kid is 18m now and the store gives out free bananas to children. She wolfs a whole banana down every time we shop. \\n\\n- builds your confidence bringing a kid in public\\n\\n- my final point, the best reason to bring a baby grocery shopping: it reduces the amount of \\\"man hours\\\" in a day. Hear me out. If you have a spouse who shares the childcare, between the two of you you have to do a certain amount of active childcare time and chore time. Let's call that combined number 15 hours. If you spend an hour at the grocery store with your child, that's an hour of chore time and an hour of childcare over lapping reducing the over all load to 14 hours. While you are gone the spouse can either take a break or do some chores stuff. See how that \\\"opens\\\" another hour in the schedule?\",\n          \"Also wondering how many you initially wanted and how many you ended up having and why.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Comment_Content\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 80,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Just to clarify, he only booked plane tickets?

Meals were simple. Soup. Bread, butter and cheese. Hard boiled eggs and so on. It’s much easier to wash one plate for yourself and one pot of soup as opposed to what we are used to now- chopping bord, salad bowl, side plates, wine glasses and water glasses, potato dish and so on and then oven sheets, pan and pot, chefs knife and blah blah blah. My grandma literally used one knife to peel the vegetables and would chop the ingredients straight to the pot of soup -no chopping board. \\n\\nWindows were cleaned in spring time as well as all the bed linen washed around easter time. All the linens were organized for the following year. Bed linens were washed less often than we do it now especially in winter times. \\n\\nIt was absolutely expected that everyone in the family will help. Even toddlers were expected to feed the chicks. \\n\\nThe house was made of wood entirely and that is literally impossible to actually clean. You can mop for sure, but you will not expect to clean all the nooks and crannies. No spider webs and socks don’t stick? Good enough! Our case is different as we have polished woods and tile that needs to be perfectly perfect. \\n\\nShe breastfed and co-slept with all her children. Unfortunately, babies were also tied to trees while left alone while she was working. That was the way of keeping them “safe”. My grandmother recalls my mother and her twin sister eating earth worms they dug up while tied somewhere in the gardens. Children crying was a total norm. It was considered that alive, fed, dressed and healthy baby is totally enough. They did not know about emotional needs children have, nor they had the time to care.\\n\\nLong story short, I am the first generation of healed children in that family. Being tied to a tree crying for (possibly) hours definitely made them all insecure, some worse than others. \\n\\nOh and my great grandmother was 16 when she married and got pregnant so it’s not like she had any capacity to even start understanding complex children psychologically. She knew that as long as a kid is clean and fed she did her job well. As I understand she considered herself a model mother, wife and woman. And I am sure she was.

She\\u2019s been doing this for about a year.\\n\\nThis morning she woke me up to let me know that she was about to leave as she usually does. \\n\\nAfter a little while she came back into my room and asked if i wanted to come with her. I was very surprised and a little confused but immediately agreed.\\n\\nShe said she didn\\u2019t want to talk, just wanted to hike and listen to her AirPods. About halfway through my own AirPods died and she offered me one of hers. So we listened to an artist named Ethel Khan, I didn\\u2019t particularly care for the music but the bonding was so heartwarming for me.\\n\\nAfterwards we went to Panda Express and talked about music for a little bit in the car.\\n\\nIt was really nice, easily the most amount of time we\\u2019ve spent together since she was 14 and I hope she\\u2019s up to spend more time together in the future.\\n\",\n          \"If your baby sits up on their own, the grocery store is an amazing activity. Here are my tips/ reasons.\\n\\n\\n- park next to the cart corral\\n\\n- do a short list the first time \\n\\n- let grocery shopping take a long time eventually. Show your child every item and describe what it is. \\\"This is zucchini, it's green, it's a vegetable, mommy is going to roast it.\\\" The grocery store is an excellent place to teach your child a lot of words. There's endless source material, you will never run out of things to say. You can count how many tomatoes you're buying too. Now that mine is a little older she helps me out stuff in the cart. Even if it takes longer than shopping by yourself, you didn't just shop you entertained and did active education. \\n\\n- go when the old folks go if you can. Old folks love babies and many of them will give you and kiddo positive attention. Kiddo gets exposed to people they don't know, you get the good vibes you desperately need.\\n\\n- grocery stores are very stimulating and it's good for babies to experience new environments like that. \\n\\n- bring a snack/toy/bottle if you need to. My kid is 18m now and the store gives out free bananas to children. She wolfs a whole banana down every time we shop. \\n\\n- builds your confidence bringing a kid in public\\n\\n- my final point, the best reason to bring a baby grocery shopping: it reduces the amount of \\\"man hours\\\" in a day. Hear me out. If you have a spouse who shares the childcare, between the two of you you have to do a certain amount of active childcare time and chore time. Let's call that combined number 15 hours. If you spend an hour at the grocery store with your child, that's an hour of chore time and an hour of childcare over lapping reducing the over all load to 14 hours. While you are gone the spouse can either take a break or do some chores stuff. See how that \\\"opens\\\" another hour in the schedule?\",\n          \"Also wondering how many you initially wanted and how many you ended up having and why.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Comment_Content\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 80,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Just to clarify, he only booked plane tickets?
