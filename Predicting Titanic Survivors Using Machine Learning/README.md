**Predicting Titanic Survivors Using Machine Learning**

For this classic machine learning project, I utilized the Titanic dataset from Kaggle to predict passenger survival rates based on various features. The project involed:
- Exploring and preprocessing a rich dataset containing demographic, ticket, and socio-economic information.
- Building and evaluating machine learning models to accurately predict survival outcomes.
- Analyzing model performance and refining the approach to improve prediction accuracy.

**Skills Used:**
- Machine Learning
- Python Programming
